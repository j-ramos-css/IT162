	<p>Hi, my name is Julio and I'm an aspiring web designer/developer and have been working towards a degree for a year. Initially I was looking towards the graphic design world but decided to shhift gears.</p>
	<p>Initially from New Hampshire, I moved to Portland when I was 18 which opened my eyes to the amazing design produced in the PNW.</p>
	<p>My focus has been towards design and the user. I believe a website must not only function properly, but exceed a users expectations in terms of usability and design. My goal is to create these websites with a company that I can grow with.</p>
